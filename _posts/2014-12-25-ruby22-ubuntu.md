title: Installing Ruby 2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04
---

Today I tried installing Ruby 2.2.0, which [just came out][ruby-post], on my Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) machine.

The build (through the excellent [ruby-build][]) failed though, and inspecting the logs, the error seemed to be related to `libffi`:

    linking shared-object fiddle.so
    /usr/bin/ld: ./libffi-3.2.1/.libs/libffi.a(raw_api.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
    ./libffi-3.2.1/.libs/libffi.a: error adding symbols: Bad value
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

The solution was to simply install `libffi-dev`:

    sudo aptitude install libffi-dev

And then the installation proceeded without problems.
